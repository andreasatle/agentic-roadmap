structural_intent:
  document_goal: 'Explain why many agentic systems break down in real-world production
    environments and articulate architectural principles that prevent these failures.

    '
  audience: 'Senior software engineers, ML engineers, architects, and technical leaders
    evaluating or building agentic systems for production use.

    '
  tone: 'Critical, precise, experience-driven, and skeptical of hype.

  required_sections:
  - Introduction
  - Failure modes in production agentic systems
  - Architectural causes of failure
  - Constraints as a design principle
  - Implications for production systems
  - Conclusion
  forbidden_sections:
  - Tutorials
  - Step-by-step guides
  - Marketing pitch
  - Tool comparisons
  - Beginner explanations
semantic_constraints:
  must_include:
  - Production failures are systemic, not model-quality issues
  - Lack of explicit constraints leads to instability
  - Unbounded agent autonomy increases operational risk
  - Intelligence must be shifted into system architecture, not agent freedom
  - Determinism, observability, and ownership are core requirements
  - Failures often emerge only under real load, cost, and latency pressure
  must_avoid:
  - Claims that larger models alone solve agent reliability
  - Overly optimistic language about autonomous agents
  - Vague references to "AI magic" or emergent intelligence
  - Prescriptive tool evangelism
  - Anthropomorphic framing of agents
  required_mentions:
  - Production environments
  - Failure modes
  - Constraints
  - Controllers or control planes
  - Deterministic execution
  - Observability and traceability
  - Cost and resource boundaries
  - Human accountability
