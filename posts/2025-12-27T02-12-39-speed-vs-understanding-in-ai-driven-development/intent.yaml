structural_intent:
  document_goal: 'Examine the tradeoff between rapid iteration speed and deep system
    understanding in AI-driven software development, and argue that excessive speed
    can conceal architectural debt that ultimately reduces overall throughput.

    '
  audience: 'Senior software engineers, technical leads, and architects working with
    AI-assisted development tools.

    '
  tone: 'Analytical, reflective, and critical; cautionary without being alarmist.

  required_sections:
  - Speed as a default optimization in AI-driven development
  - How fast iteration creates the illusion of progress
  - Architectural debt as deferred complexity
  - Loss of system-level understanding
  - Why slowing down can increase long-term throughput
  forbidden_sections:
  - Tool-specific tutorials
  - Marketing or promotional content
  - Speculative future predictions about AI
semantic_constraints:
  must_include:
  - A clear distinction between local iteration speed and system-level throughput
  - An explanation of how architectural debt can remain invisible during early success
  - The idea that understanding is a first-class engineering asset
  must_avoid:
  - Framing the issue as purely cultural or motivational
  - Treating speed and understanding as mutually exclusive absolutes
  required_mentions:
  - architectural debt
  - system-level understanding
  - feedback loops
