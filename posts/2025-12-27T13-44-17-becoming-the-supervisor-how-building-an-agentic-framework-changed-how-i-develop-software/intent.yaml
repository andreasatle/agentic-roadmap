structural_intent:
  document_goal: "Explain how the act of implementing Planner\u2013Worker\u2013Critic\
    \ controllers led the author to implicitly adopt the same control structure in\
    \ their own development workflow, effectively treating ChatGPT and Codex as planner\
    \ and worker agents under a human supervisor role.\n"
  audience: 'Experienced software engineers and AI practitioners interested in agentic
    systems, control structures, and reflective development practices.

    '
  tone: 'Reflective and analytical; focused on mechanism and insight rather than outcome
    or success narrative.

  required_sections:
  - Initial goal of implementing PWC controllers
  - How controller design shaped interaction patterns
  - Treating ChatGPT as planner and Codex as worker
  - The author assuming the supervisor role
  - Critique as an explicit control phase
  - How tooling design fed back into human behavior
  forbidden_sections:
  - Step-by-step implementation guides
  - Claims of autonomous or self-directed agents
  - Tool marketing or productivity hype
semantic_constraints:
  must_include:
  - The idea that control abstractions influenced behavior outside the codebase
  - A clear mapping between PWC roles and real development interactions
  - An explanation that the workflow emerged implicitly, not by deliberate design
  - The notion that the framework functioned as a cognitive scaffold
  must_avoid:
  - Framing the experience as a success story or case study
  - Suggesting that the tools possessed agency or intent
  - Generalizing the workflow as a best practice for all developers

  - "Planner\u2013Worker\u2013Critic"
