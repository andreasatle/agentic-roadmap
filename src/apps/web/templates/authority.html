            <h1>Authority Boundaries</h1>
            <h2>
                Explicit trust, responsibility, and control boundaries
                across the agentic execution stack.
            </h2>
            <p>
                This page defines which components are trusted, which are not,
                and where authority explicitly begins and ends.

            <h2>Core Principle</h2>
            <p>
                The system is designed around a single rule:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>LLM agents are never trusted.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                All authority resides in deterministic, typed, and auditable
                components. Agents produce suggestions; they do not execute power.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Authority Map</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Controller</strong><br>
                    Owns execution order, state transitions, and termination.
                    Enforces the finite state machine and execution bounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AgentDispatcher</strong><br>
                    Owns schema validation and retry limits at agent boundaries.
                    Does not interpret intent or results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ToolRegistry</strong><br>
                    Owns all side effects. Tools are deterministic, typed,
                    and invoked explicitly by the Controller only.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Agents (Planner / Worker / Critic)</strong><br>
                    Untrusted. Emit JSON only. No side effects, no control flow,
                    no retries, no state mutation.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Agents Are Not Allowed To Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Advance workflow state</li>
                <li>Invoke tools directly</li>
                <li>Retry themselves</li>
                <li>Spawn other agents</li>
                <li>Mutate domain or system state</li>
                <li>Decide termination or acceptance</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Controller Authority</h2>
            <p>
                The Controller is the sole authority responsible for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enforcing PLAN → WORK → TOOL → CRITIC → END</li>
                <li>Validating agent outputs via schemas</li>
                <li>Routing execution between agents</li>
                <li>Invoking tools exactly once per request</li>
                <li>Producing an immutable execution trace</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Controller executes exactly one task per request.
                Any looping or retry policy is external by design.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>
                By making authority explicit:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Failures are deterministic and inspectable</li>
                <li>Security boundaries are enforceable</li>
                <li>Agent misbehavior cannot escalate</li>
                <li>Auditing and replay are straightforward</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This architecture favors predictability and governance
                over emergent autonomy.
            </p>
