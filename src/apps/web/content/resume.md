## Professional Experience

### Independent AI Engineer — Enterprise Agents

**Houston, TX · 2021–Present**

* Designed and deployed **production LLM agent pipelines** using OpenAI Agent SDK and **strict Pydantic schemas**, processing 1,300+ legal documents with **deterministic validation, bounded retries, and auditable outputs**, reducing manual review effort by 70%.
* Implemented **agent governance safeguards**, including planner isolation, schema enforcement, and explicit ACCEPT/REJECT evaluation steps to prevent hallucinations, prompt injection, and uncontrolled state mutation.
* Built embedding‑based **RAG systems** (ChromaDB) enabling secure, structured retrieval across legal and financial corpora, optimized for accuracy and inference cost.
* Collaborated with non‑technical stakeholders to redesign document‑review workflows with agents at the center, balancing automation gains with operational reliability.

### Software Developer — Spectacle LLC

**Remote · 2022–2023**

* Deployed ML models (BERT‑based classifiers, translation, content moderation) into **AWS EKS**, supporting production workloads.
* Built high‑throughput APIs using **gRPC and Python**, emphasizing reliability, observability, and operational correctness.

### Scientific Researcher — Total E&P USA

**Houston, TX · 2009–2020**

* Developed **high‑performance numerical algorithms** for seismic imaging and inversion, deployed on HPC clusters.
* Accelerated production workflows using **MPI and CUDA**, emphasizing numerical stability, performance guarantees, and reproducibility.

### Postdoctoral Researcher — Memorial University of Newfoundland

**St. John’s, Canada · 2006–2009**

* Developed advanced finite‑difference and eikonal solvers adopted in seismic inversion workflows.
