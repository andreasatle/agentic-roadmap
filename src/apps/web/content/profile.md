# Profile - Andreas Atle

I work on **controlled, production-grade AI systems**, with a focus on **agentic architectures that are constrained, auditable, and predictable**.

Lately, my work has centered on designing and implementing a **schema-driven document system** built around explicit intent envelopes, deterministic agent execution, and strict validation boundaries. The goal is not autonomous behavior, but **reliable transformation of structured human intent into structured outputs**, suitable for real workflows.

Recent work includes:

- Building an **intent-driven document writer** with explicit Planner–Worker–Critic separation and schema-validated I/O.
- Designing UI and backend contracts that favor **clarity over abstraction**, avoiding hidden framework behavior and layout drift.
- Iterating on **agent governance patterns**: bounded retries, explicit failure modes, and zero silent degradation.
- Starting a **PDF → legal-text extraction pipeline**, focused on best-possible fidelity, explicit uncertainty tracking, and disciplined OCR correction rather than “helpful” guessing.

Across projects, the emphasis is consistent:

- Determinism over cleverness
- Explicit contracts over inference
- Systems that are understandable months later, not just impressive once

I am interested in work where **engineering discipline matters**, especially at the boundary between human intent, automation, and accountability.
